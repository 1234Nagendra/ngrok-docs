### [ngrok-go Library](/using-ngrok-with/go)  {#ngrok-go}

ngrok-go is the ngrok agent in library form. It allows you to launch and configure ngrok tunnels straight from your source code, without requiring agents

### [App Users](/cloud-edge/app-users) {#app-users}

With App Users, ngrok gives admins the power to review user sessions to tunnels in flight programmatically — via our REST APIs — and via our dashboard. Grant, revoke, or even block access in real time

### [Dashboard SSO](/platform/dashboard#dashboard-sso) {#dashboard-sso}

Secure access to the ngrok Dashboard with your Single Sign-On (SSO) Provider — including Okta, Azure AD, and any SAML 2.0 solution and keep IT and security happy

### [SSH Reverse Tunnel](/docs/secure-tunnels/tunnels/ssh-reverse-tunnel-agent) {#reverse-tunnel}

SSH reverse tunneling is an alternative mechanism to start an ngrok tunnel without needing to download or run the ngrok agent. You can start tunnels via SSH without downloading an ngrok agent by running an SSH reverse tunnel command.

Examples:

`ngrok http 80`

```bash
ssh -R 80:localhost:80 tunnel.us.ngrok.com http
```

And even add middleware:

equivalent: `ngrok http --hostname=example.com --oauth "google" 8080`

```bash
ssh -R example.com:80:localhost:8080 tunnel.us.ngrok.com http -oauth="google"
```

### New OAuth 2.0 Providers  {#new-oauth-providers}

Expanding our OAuth capabilities, we recently added support for GitLab, LinkedIn, and Twitch. You can use any as a generic identity provider or request specific scopes to give your apps fine-grained access to those systems in seconds. For example:

```bash
ngrok http 3000 --oauth=twitch
```

### Signed Windows Agent

As of v3.1.0, all releases of the ngrok agent come signed to verify authenticity. The signing process is baked into our deployment process to ensure consistency across every release. 

Shout out to osslsigncode for making this possible on our Linux hosts! Additionally, we took time to display metadata on the executable using syso files.

Shout out to go-winres for helping automate this!

### ngrok Partner Program

As we build our apps, we have to integrate with tools, APIs, and systems to ship great software quickly. With our partnership program, we’re making those integrations available out of the box and publishing howtos, guides, and docs to support you.

We’ve published over 30 integrations and have dozens more in mind. Let us know if we’re missing your favorite! 

Are you a potential Partner that wants to integrate more deeply?


## August 2022

### Webhook Verification at the Edge

Webhook Verification authenticates that requests to your upstream application are correctly signed for your app at the ngrok edge and drops unauthorized traffic before it reaches your service.

We’ve greatly expanded our supported providers for webhook verification. We now support over 50 providers. New additions include Microsoft Teams, Docusign, Heroku, Hubspot, Mailchimp, PagerDuty, Zendesk, and Zoom.

### ngrok Community Slack

We launched the ngrok community slack to bring developers together to see, share, and explore what they're doing with ngrok. It's your place to learn and lend each other a hand, show off projects, and generally see what’s happening in and around the ecosystem.

### SOC 2 Type 2 Compliance

We're excited to announce that we completed our SOC 2 Type 2 testing with no findings. In short, that means we write and follow policies that protect the security of our systems and customer data. If you or your team need our report or any other compliance documents, check out our new security and trust portal.

### New Java and Scala API Client Libraries 

Manage ngrok programmatically with updated versions of the ngrok Java (Github / Maven Central) and Scala (Github / Maven Central) SDKs.

### Abuse Mitigation 

You may have seen the scary red “dangerous site” screen in Chrome. That came from bad actors misusing and abusing ngrok. In the last few quarters, we’ve improved our mitigation, detection, reporting, and response capabilities to eliminate most abuse. There is still more to do but our goal is to be rid of that “dangerous site” warning.

### Billing Protection

Now you can control your ngrok bill to stay within your license or allow overages. Just visit your Subscription page and change your preference in seconds.
