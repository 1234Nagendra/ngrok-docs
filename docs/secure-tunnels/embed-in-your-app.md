# Embed ngrok in your app
--------------------

With ngrok libraries, you can embed ngrok tunnels in your application, providing public and secure networking without requiring additional agents, Firewalls, NATs, and VPNs.

Because the network goes with your app, it also eliminates the manual configuration required to run your app in remote networks, IoT environments, multi-cloud, and B2B use cases. The libraries also leverage the security controls available in ngrok — including OAuth, Encryption, Observability, Webhook Validations, and IP restrictions — meeting security requirements for production applications.

At this point, we offer a library for Go, although we plan to support additional programming languages shortly.
