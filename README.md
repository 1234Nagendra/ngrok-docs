# [ngrok docs](https://ngrok.com/docs)

This is the source for the [ngrok docs](https://ngrok.com/docs); feel free to suggest changes and improvements to our documentation!

### Setup

ngrok is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

To setup our docs in your host, simply

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-docs.git
$ cd ngrok-docs
$ yarn && yarn start
```

While our Docusaurus uses mostly markdowns, you can make yourself familiar with its [documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation) for more significant changes.
